    "description": "Meet Ronny the Animatronic Bunny. His mission has been to rescue kids attacked by evil animatronics and bad adults. Ronny is very very old, but he doesn\u2019t notice that. One day people decided to remove one of his eyes to install a camera. They thought that this would make him much stronger and would immensely improve his sight, but Ronny ran away. Now he\u2019s angry and full of vengeance. Still, Ronny loves kids and won\u2019t let anyone harm them. Join Mira\u2019s creatures in making this world safer for children and babies affected by the war.",
